He had an idea for a scheme to feed himself. He explained to the fish, frogs, and crabs that there wouldn't be any fish in the pond since some guys were going to fill it up and plant crops there. He also expressed to them his sadness and his intention to miss each of them. The stork was requested to assist the fish, who were depressed. They will all be brought to a larger pond, the stork assured them. "As I am old, I can only take a few of you at one go," he informed them, nevertheless. After bringing the fish to a rock, the stork would kill and devour them. He used to take some of them to the rock and eat them whenever he felt hungry.

A crab that was living in the pond desired to move to the larger pond as well. The stork decided to assist him and considered having a change of pace by eating the crab. "Where is the big pond?" the crab enquired of the stork as they travelled. With a giggle, the stork gestured to the fish-bones-filled rock. The crab immediately came up with a method to save himself after realising that the stork would kill him. He grabbed the stork by the neck and held on to it till it passed away.

Once upon a time, on the banks of a river, lived a monkey who called a jamoon (berry) tree home in a jungle. There lived a crocodile and his spouse in the same woodland. The crocodile visited the riverbanks one day and took a nap beneath the tree. The generous monkey extended an offer of fruits to him. The crocodile enjoyed the fruits so much that he returned the next day for more. The crocodile and the monkey grew close as the days went by.

The crocodile's wife received some fruits from the monkey one day. Although she enjoyed the fruits, she was envious of her husband for spending time with the monkey. "I wonder how sweet the monkey's heart would be if the fruits were so juicy," she said to her husband. Please bring me the monkey's heart. The crocodile had no option but to murder his companion, even if he did not want to.

He said that his wife would want to meet the monkey and asked him to supper. The crocodile carried the contented monkey on its back as it was unable to swim. While chatting, the crocodile revealed the true purpose of taking the monkey home, even though he was pleased that he had misled the monkey. "You should have told me earlier I left my heart on the tree," the astute monkey remarked. We have to return and retrieve it. He was taken back to the tree by the crocodile, who found him credible. The astute monkey, therefore, spared his life.

Cinderella had a heart full of love, but unfortunately, fate hadn't been kind to Cinderella. Her mother had passed away, leaving her alone with her selfish stepmother.",
  '\n The stepmother had two daughters of her own, and she was terribly jealous of Cinderella's beauty and kind heart. She treated Cinderella unfairly, making her do all the housework and dress in rags while her own daughters wore fine clothes and lived in luxury.

Despite the cruelty she faced, Cinderella remained kind and gentle, never letting her stepmother's unkindness change who she was. She would often seek comfort in the garden, talking to the birds and the animals, who had become her dearest friends.

One day, the kingdom received exciting news. The prince was hosting a grand ball at the palace, and every maiden in the land was invited. Cinderella's stepsisters were overjoyed and spent weeks preparing their gowns and practicing their dance moves.
Cinderella watched her stepsisters with a sad smile, hoping she might be able to attend the ball and experience a bit of the magic she had heard about in her mother's stories. But her stepmother was insistent that Cinderella would stay home and continue with her chores.

The night of the ball arrived, and Cinderella was left alone in her old clothes while her stepsisters and stepmother departed for the palace. She sat by the fireplace, tears in her eyes, wishing for just a taste of the magic her mother had told her about.

Suddenly, a soft, sweet voice filled the room. It was her fairy godmother, a beautiful figure surrounded by a soft, glowing light.

"Why are you crying, my dear?" the fairy godmother asked.

Cinderella explained her wish to attend the ball but how her stepmother had been unkind and refused to allow her to go.The fairy godmother smiled and said, "Don't worry, my child. You shall go to the ball."

With a wave of her wand, Cinderella's rags were transformed into a stunning gown, and on her feet, she wore the most delicate glass slippers that sparkled like stars. Her fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a magnificent carriage and mice into beautiful horses, so Cinderella could travel to the palace in style.

Before she left, the fairy godmother gave Cinderella a piece of advice: "Remember, my dear, the magic will only last until midnight. When the clock strikes twelve, you must leave the palace and return home."

Cinderella thanked her fairy godmother and climbed into the magical carriage. As she arrived at the palace, she felt like a princess, her heart dancing with joy.

The moment Cinderella entered the ballroom, the entire room fell silent. The prince, charmed by her beauty, approached her, and they danced together like a dream. Cinderella was the happiest she had ever been.But as the hours flew by, she suddenly heard the bells of the palace clock. The first stroke of midnight sent a shiver down her spine. She remembered her fairy godmother's warning and knew she must leave.

Cinderella hurriedly said goodbye to the prince and fled from the palace. As she ran down the grand staircase, one of her glass slippers slipped off her foot. She didn't have time to retrieve it, and so, with only one glass slipper, she disappeared into the night.

Cinderella's beautiful gown and glass slippers turned back into rags, leaving her with only the memory of the enchanting evening she had spent at the palace.

The next day, the prince was determined to find the owner of the glass slipper. He and his attendants traveled throughout the kingdom, visiting every home to see if the slipper would fit any young maiden.

When they arrived at Cinderella's cottage, her stepsisters eagerly tried to fit their feet into the glass slipper. But it was too small for them, and their feet simply couldn't squeeze in.

Cinderella watched, hidden from view, as her stepsisters attempted to trick the prince. Then, she stepped forward and, with a hopeful heart, asked, "May I try?"

The prince agreed, and as she placed her foot into the glass slipper, it fit perfectly. The prince's eyes lit up with joy as he realized he had found the maiden he had danced with at the ball.

Cinderella's stepsisters were astonished and upset. But even though they were mean to her, Cinderella didn't feel angry. Instead, she forgave them for their unkindness, as she believed that kindness was the most important thing in the world.

And so, Cinderella was reunited with the prince, and they lived happily ever after, proving that goodness, kindness, and a loving heart could overcome the challenges life may bring.
Moral of the Story:

Being kind and having a loving heart can help you through tough times. Even though Cinderella faced meanness and hard work, she stayed kind and gentle, and her goodness led to her happiness and success. The story also shows the importance of forgiveness, as Cinderella forgave her stepsisters, teaching us that being kind and forgiving are very important.'''),

They slowly climbed the embankment to cross the track, taking care not to drop the baskets. They were very near the track and the little sister was about the cross it, when they heard the distinct horn of a train.

The older sister got frightened and ran back. She thought that the young one was following her. She turned back and was shocked to see her little sister still crossing the track. "Come back here, run back fast," she screamed.

It seemed that the little girl could not hear her sister. She was still concentrating on stepping over the track with her little feet, and holding on to the basket. Then she tripped and fell on the track, scattering her mushrooms around. She sat down and began picking them up and putting in her basket.

In the meanwhile the elder sister had become hysteric. She cried and screamed, calling her little sister to leave the mushrooms and run back, but it seemed as though the little one could not hear her.

The engine driver panicked on seeing the girl and blew his whistle with all his might, but she appeared not to hear the whistle. Her sister was now crying loudly, overcome by panic, as the little sister crawled between the tracks on her hands and knees, to pick the rest of the mushrooms.

The engine driver was helpless as it was not possible for him to stop the engine suddenly. He blew the whistle as hard as he could, but the engine rolled over the little girl. The older sister clasped her face with her trembling hands and cried bitterly. The passengers too panicked at the thought of the sight they would have to witness. The guard ran down to the end of the train to see what happened to the little girl. When the train passed, everybody saw her lying very still between the tracks with her face down.

Then she raised her head, sprang to her knees and began gathering the remaining mushrooms.

The big sister ran towards her, tears streaming down her face. They hugged and kissed each other, crying out of happiness, tears of joy flowing down their little cheeks. Never were two souls so happily united as at that moment. She promised her little sister that thereafter she would hold her hand tightly while crossing the railway line.

The two sisters then picked all the remaining mushrooms, and hand in hand, solemnly walked back home. They were indeed two souls who had become wiser than their years, in the span of a few minutes.''',

    content: '''It was time for Baby to go to bed. Mama and Papa tucked him in safely in his crib. They made sure to leave the night-light on, and its soft glow filled the room. Mama and Papa stood in the doorway and blew kisses to Baby before they tiptoed off down the hallway. "Sweet dreams, Baby!" said Papa.
But there was just one little problem. Baby couldn't go to sleep without his teddy bear — and Teddy was nowhere to be found!

Baby wondered what he should do. His first thought was that maybe he should start to cry.If he started to cry, Mama and Papa would surely come back to the nursery to see what was the matter. But Baby didn't want to make Mama and Papa upset. He wasn't sure how to tell them that his Teddy was lost, either. So Baby decided not to cry. He would have to find Teddy on his own.

Baby stood up in his crib, carefully holding on to the rails for balance. Baby was very good at standing up in his crib, but he was still too little to climb out. Baby looked around the nursery to see if he could spy his Teddy.

Meanwhile, out in the hallway, keen-eared Puppy heard Baby moving about in his crib. Puppy came bounding toward the nursery for a visit. Puppy pushed his snout against the door and it swung open with a creak. Puppy ran into the nursery, wagging his tail happily. Baby was happy to see his friend Puppy. Baby hoped that Puppy could help him look for Teddy, since Puppy could roam freely around the nursery while Baby could not leave his crib. Baby tried to tell Puppy that he was trying to find his Teddy. Unfortunately, Baby wasn't very good at talking yet. Nor was Puppy very good at understanding things. So as Baby waved his arms and made little noises, Puppy got very excited. He thought that Baby just wanted to play! Soon Puppy was bouncing here and there, knocking over toys and making quite a commotion.

Sshhh, Puppy!

Puppy looked so funny bouncing around on the floor that Baby began to giggle a little bit. Then Baby began to chuckle. Then Baby began to laugh a great big belly laugh! Baby laughed so hard and so heartily, he had to rest for a moment. Still chuckling, Baby sat down on the soft quilt in his crib.

As Baby rested and thought about that silly Puppy, he noticed that his crib felt unusually lumpy and bumpy. Baby thought that was very curious. He pressed on the quilt. It felt like there might be something soft and cuddly underneath! Baby slowly pulled back the quilt. And do you know what he saw? One little brown ear. Then another little brown ear. Then a fuzzy brown head, and two little kind eyes, and a big soft nose … it was Teddy! He had been in the crib with Baby all along! Baby was so happy.Baby snuggled close to his teddy bear, feeling very cozy and warm and safe. Now Baby was ready to fall asleep. His little eyes closed and he was sleeping soundly in no time at all.

Good night, Baby!''',

    content: '''More than a hundred years ago, in the Wild West, a child was born. That child was named Pecos Bill.
Now when Pecos Bill was still a baby, his parents were moving from one ranch to another. Bill was sound asleep in the back of their covered wagon when the wagon hit a bump. The bump bumped poor Bill out of the wagon and onto the hard desert ground. But Bill's parents had no idea that their baby was missing and kept on riding.

Luckily, a family of coyotes found the boy and raised him as their own pup. By day, Pecos Bill learned to live on his own in the hot desert. Each night, after a long day of hunting, Bill and his coyote family howled at the moon. Once Pecos Bill had grown to be a man, he left his coyote family behind and went to live with people once again. Living the life of a cowboy, Pecos Bill had many, many adventures, some of which I'm about to tell you.Pecos Bill's first great adventure was the time when he rode Widow-Maker. Widow-Maker was a horse, but not just any horse. You see, Widow-Maker was the roughest, toughest, meanest, strongest horse any cowboy had ever ridden — or tried to ride, anyway. Nobody had been able to stay on Widow-Maker. He was just too ornery.

Whenever a cowboy got up the gumption to climb onto Widow-Maker's back, that big black stallion would buck and kick and thrash. He would snort and stomp and toss his head. And pretty soon, he would toss that poor cowboy right out of the saddle and onto the dry, dusty desert dirt.Nope, no cowboy ever had what it took to ride old Widow-Maker. No cowboy, that is, except for Pecos Bill.One day Bill had watched Widow-Maker toss one cowboy after another onto the dirt and decided that he'd seen enough.

"Why don't I show you boys how it's done?" he asked, tightening his belt and jingling his spurs.

So Pecos Bill climbed onto Widow-Maker's back and the rest of the cowboys held their breath, waiting for Widow-Maker to toss Bill just as he had tossed all the rest.Widow-Maker bucked and kicked and thrashed. He snorted and stomped and tossed his head. That horse tried every trick he knew to toss this cowboy off his back. But Pecos Bill wasn't tossed anywhere. Hanging on tight, Bill waited until Widow-Maker was all tired out. That crazy horse had met his match — and now he had a new master.Taming that ornery cuss Widow-Maker was not the only adventure that Pecos Bill had. You know how cowboys use a looped rope called a lasso?

One day, when Pecos Bill was out tending his herd of cattle, the cows started to stampede. The herd was getting away, and Bill realized that he had forgotten his lasso at home. Thinking quickly, Pecos Bill caught a few rattlesnakes, tied them together, and with this rattling, hissing lasso, Pecos Bill roped that whole herd of cattle just like that!

Another time when Pecos Bill was out tending to his cattle, he heard a roar come from the tumbleweed. Bill turned around to see a snarling mountain lion ready to sink its sharp fangs and claws into one of the cows.Bill wasn't about to let some mangy old kitty cat run off with one of his prized heifers, so he took out his lasso and roped that mountain lion just like he would a pony. Then he climbed on the angry cat's back and began to whoop and holler.

"Whoopee! How do you like this, you dad-gum pussy cat?" Pecos Bill laughed. "You won't be eating any of my cows now, will you? Yeehaw!"Yes, Pecos Bill had many, many adventures in the Wild West. And yes, he was just about the rootin-est, tootin-est cowpoke to ever climb into the saddle. There wasn't a horse he couldn't ride. There wasn't a challenge that could stop him.But one day Pecos Bill met his match. Her name was Slue-Foot Sue.Slue-Foot Sue was the prettiest girl this side of the Mississippi River. Her hair was as golden as Kansas wheat. Her cheeks were as rosy as an Arizona sunset.

Now Pecos Bill had never felt the slightest fear when riding an angry bull or facing a nest full of rattlers. But moseying up to Slue-Foot Sue to say hello made Bill more nervous than a jackrabbit in a wolf den. Luckily, Sue broke the ice and introduced herself to Bill. And before you know it, the two were married.

Married life didn't do much to tame Pecos Bill, though. There was the one time that a blustery, twisting cyclone threatened to fly off with Bill's herd of cattle. But just like he wouldn't let a mountain lion touch one of his cows, Pecos Bill wasn't about to let an old cyclone, either.

So Pecos Bill got out his trusty lasso and tossed it around the cyclone. Off the angry twister flew, determined to throw Bill south of the Rio Grande. But our hero held on tight, and soon that cyclone petered out. Pecos Bill had triumphed once again!And speaking of the Rio Grande, we all know what a long and winding river that is. Well, I've heard tell that Pecos Bill used the whole thing, that great big river that winds and stretches for as far as the eye can see, to water the crops he grew on his ranch! That Pecos Bill sure was a son of a gun! Throughout his long and exciting life, Pecos Bill had many more adventures, with earthquakes and rattlesnakes, with growling grizzly bears and dashing desert hares, with stampeding steers and fleet-footed mule deer. He had so many wild and woolly adventures that it would fill this whole book just to tell a few of them.As the years passed, Pecos Bill and Slue-Foot Sue grew old and gray. Bill still tended his ranch and cattle, and he still rode old Widow-Maker, who had grown a little gray himself.

But after his long days of riding and working, Pecos Bill would feel a little more sore and tired than he had when he was a young cowpoke. So he was happy to sit with his beloved Slue-Foot Sue and watch the desert sun set on the fine spread that they called home. And that, my friends, is the story of Pecos Bill.''',

    content: '''Once upon a time, there was a goat living near the forest. She had seven kids and loved them a lot.

One day, the goat wanted to bring food for her kids. She had to go to the forest. He warned her kids, "Never open the door for anyone. The eyes of the wolf are on us." She said goodbye to her kids and got out.

The wolf was watching the hut of the goat. His favourite food was lamb flesh. When he saw the goat leaving, he immediately went to the hut and knocked on the door, "Hİ, Kids. It is Mom. Please open the door. I bought food for you." The kids were clever, and they understood that I wasn't their mother. They said, "You are not the mother. You can't fool us! Go away!"

The wolf tried to fake the voice of the goat. After practising for a while, he went to the hut and knocked on the door again, "Hello kids! Open the door. Mother is here!". The kids were smart so, they looked outside through the magic glass of the door. They recognized the feet of the wolf and said, "No way! We will not open the door. Your feet are different from mother's. Her feet are white."

The wolf heard this and went to the grocer's shop. He wanted him to colour his feet to white with flour. The grocer didn't understand why the wolf wanted this, but he did what the wolf said as he was afraid of. Thus, the feet of wolf became white. He immediately went to the hut of goat and knocked on the door, "Hello kids! It is the mom. Open the door!".

The kids again peeped through the magic glass and saw the white feet. They opened the door. The wolf got in. When they see the wolf, they rushed to hide somewhere. Some hid under the bed, some behind the curtains. The wolf caught them and ate up. However, one of the kids hid inside of the big clock. The wolf couldn't find him.

The mother goat was about to reach the hut. She was thinking that the kids would be happy to see the foods. She reached after some time. But she was shocked when she saw the door open. She got in and couldn't see any of her kids. She started to cry and said "What happened to you? My poor kids! I said you not to open the door. The wolf ate up you. I lost you all."

At that moment, the kid who hid inside of the clock spoke, "Mom! It is me, your youngest kid. I am in the clock. Take me out." The goat took out her kid and kissed him again and again. The kid told what happened to the other kids. Then they heard a snoring. The mother said, "The wolf must be still here. Find me long scissors and brought it."

They found the wolf sleeping in the garden. The goat got close to the wolf silently and cut open his belly with the scissors. She found her kids alive and then took them out one by one. After kissing and hugging them, she wanted to them to find stones. The kids brought the stones and put them inside the belly of the wolf. Then the goat stitched the belly and returned to the hut.

After some time, woke up and wanted to drink water. He went to the well to drink water. Since his belly was full of stones, he lost his balance and fell into the well. He drowned in the water.

The goat and the kids were watching the wolf through the window of the hut. They came out and started dancing because they got rid of the wolf and didn't need to be afraid of it anymore.''',

        '''Once upon a time, there was a flock of doves that flew in search of food led by their king. One day, they had flown a long distance and were very tired. The dove king encouraged them to fly a little further. The smallest dove picked up speed and found some rice scattered beneath a banyan tree. So all the doves landed and began to eat. 

Suddenly a net fell over them and they were all trapped. They saw a hunter approaching carrying a huge club. The doves desperately fluttered their wings trying to get out, but to no avail. The king had an idea. He advised all the doves to fly up together carrying the net with them. He said that there was strength in unity. 

Each dove picked up a portion of the net and together they flew off carrying the net with them. The hunter looked up in astonishment. He tried to follow them, but they were flying high over hills and valleys. They flew to a hill near a city of temples where there lived a mouse who could help them. He was a faithful friend of the dove king. 

When the mouse heard the loud noise of their approach, he went into hiding. The dove king gently called out to him and then the mouse was happy to see him. The dove king explained that they had been caught in a trap and needed the mouse's help to gnaw at the net with his teeth and set them free. 

The mouse agreed saying that he would set the king free first. The king insisted that he first free his subjects and the king last. The mouse understood the king's feelings and complied with his wishes. He began to cut the net and one by one all the doves were freed including the dove king. 

They all thanked the mouse and flew away together, united in their strength.

One day, when the three friends were talking to each other on the edge of the pond, some fishermen passed by. They were carrying baskets and nets with them. They saw the pond and said to one another, "This pond seems to be full of fish. Let's come tomorrow and catch them."

When the fishermen left the place, the frog said to the fish, "Friends, you also heard what the fishermen said. Let's leave this pond immediately and go to some other pond to save our lives."

But the two fish laughed. Sahasrabuddhi said, "Well, as far as I think the fishermen will never come back to catch us. But even if they do, they'll never be able to trap us, because we're expert swimmers and we know how to save ourselves."

But the frog was not convinced with the views of the fish. He said, "But I find myself not so expert in swimming. I'll definitely leave this pond along with my family by this evening, to settle down in some other pond or well."

The same evening, the frog abandoned the pond along with his family and went to a nearby pond. The next day, the fishermen came to the pond. They cast their nets and caught all the fishes. The two fish tried to escape, but in vain. They also got trapped in the net and died.

When the frog and his wife saw the fishermen returning with a lot of fish in their net, they became very sad. They looked at the net with tearful eyes as they saw that their two friends, Shatabuddhi and Sahasrabuddhi also had succumbed to death.

    content:'''One day, a long time ago, an old Miller and his Son were on their way to market with an Ass which they hoped to sell. They drove him very slowly, for they thought they would have a better chance to sell him if they kept him in good condition. As they walked along the highway some travelers laughed loudly at them.

"What foolishness," cried one, "to walk when they might as well ride. The most stupid of the three is not the one you would expect it to be."

The Miller did not like to be laughed at, so he told his son to climb up and ride.

They had gone a little farther along the road, when three merchants passed by.

"Oho, what have we here?" they cried. "Respect old age, young man! Get down, and let the old man ride."

Though the Miller was not tired, he made the boy get down and climbed up himself to ride, just to please the Merchants.

At the next turnstile they overtook some women carrying market baskets loaded with vegetables and other things to sell.

"Look at the old fool," exclaimed one of them. "Perched on the Ass, while that poor boy has to walk."

The Miller felt a bit vexed, but to be agreeable he told the Boy to climb up behind him.

They had no sooner started out again than a loud shout went up from another company of people on the road.

"What a crime," cried one, "to load up a poor dumb beast like that! They look more able to carry the poor creature, than he to carry them."

"They must be on their way to sell the poor thing's hide," said another.

The Miller and his Son quickly scrambled down, and a short time later, the market place was thrown into an uproar as the two came along carrying the Donkey slung from a pole. A great crowd of people ran out to get a closer look at the strange sight.

The Ass did not dislike being carried, but so many people came up to point at him and laugh and shout, that he began to kick and bray, and then, just as they were crossing a bridge, the ropes that held him gave way, and down he tumbled into the river.

The poor Miller now set out sadly for home. By trying to please everybody, he had pleased nobody, and lost his Ass besides.

If you try to please all, you please none.''',

    content: '''Once upon a time, deep below the ocean waves, there was a world full of mystery and wonder. Mermaids and mermen lived in this world. These fantastic creatures looked like people, but had strong, beautiful tails like fish.

In the kingdom of mermaids and mermen lived a family with six beautiful girls, or mermaids. But the littlest mermaid was the most beautiful of all. She also had the loveliest singing voice.

The six mermaid sisters dreamed of life above the waves. Whenever one of them turned fifteen years old, she would swim to the surface to watch the humans.

When it was the little mermaid's fifteenth birthday, she rushed to the water's surface. Peeking her head above the waves, the sky was even more beautiful than she had imagined! Soon she spied a ship, its sails fluttering like the fins of a dolphin.The little mermaid bobbed, like a delicate cork, up and down with the water. She watched the humans walk and run, skip and dance aboard the ship. She heard strange music played on instruments she had never seen before. The sound was loud and brash, but at the same time wonderful! This must be a party! she thought.

As she wondered at the sight of these humans, she suddenly spotted the most handsome human. He was like nobody she had ever seen. She quickly realized that he was a prince! The little mermaid fell in love with this human, watching him dance and laugh at his birthday party.

She knew that she must be part of his life. Suddenly, the sky became dark. A wind picked up and knocked over the prince's birthday cake. The prince's ship was torn to pieces by the pounding waves. The little mermaid knew that the prince could not live in the water. She used all her strength and pulled him out of the water. She took him safely to shore.After the prince was safe on dry land, the little mermaid brushed his hair from his face. She looked into his eyes and kissed his forehead. After a moment, she heard a girl's voice and knew she must leave.

She quickly dove into the water and swam back to her ­sisters. The girls were excited to hear about their little sister's journey above the waves.

"What did you see?" they asked her.The little mermaid wanted to tell her sisters about the handsome prince, but she was afraid they would laugh at her. Instead, she told them about the boat she saw. She did not tell them that she was in love with a human!

The ­sisters noticed that the little mermaid had been quiet since her journey above the waves. The little mermaid decided to tell her sisters about the prince. As she told her story, she realized that she could not live without the prince.That night, the little mermaid snuck away to see the sea witch. She knew the sea witch could give her what she wanted the most.

The journey to the sea witch was horrible. Slimy sea snakes wound around the little mermaid's arms as she swam. As she got closer to the sea witch's lair, terrible plants that looked like monsters reached out and tried to grab her.Once at the sea witch's lair, she asked her for help. The sea witch told the little mermaid that she would be happy to give her legs to walk and dance with the humans. But the sea witch told her that there was a price for such a special gift.

She told the little mermaid that all she wanted was her beautiful voice. The sea witch explained that the little mermaid would have the loveliest human legs. She would be able to dance like an angel, and even when she walked, the humans would be amazed at her graceful beauty. But, she added, the little mermaid would not be able to speak or sing.The little mermaid was so happy with the thought of being with the prince that she quickly agreed to the sea witch's demand. The sea witch made a powerful potion. She tightly sealed the potion in a gold bottle.The sea witch told the little mermaid that once she drank the potion, her tail would split in two. The little mermaid would then have human legs. What the little mermaid would not have, however, was a human soul. "You must get your true love, the prince, to pledge his love to you," said the sea witch, "then you will share his soul forever."

The sea witch went on to say that if the little mermaid's true love married another, the little mermaid would not live to see the next day.

The little mermaid was frightened, but she knew deep in her heart that the prince would love her back. Before the sea witch gave the potion to the little mermaid, she made one more potion. This one was to capture the little mermaid's voice. The little mermaid quickly drank it. Then she tried to speak, but her voice was gone.

The little mermaid took the potion in the gold bottle and swam to the surface. Once there, she drank it without hesitation. The little mermaid felt very strange, and her tail began to ache. Before her eyes, her tail became two beautiful human legs!Happy that the sea witch was true to her word, she stood up just like a human. She danced and glided on her new legs, as if she were swimming on land.On his morning walk, the prince discovered a beautiful girl on the beach. The prince was enchanted by the way she moved.The prince slowly approached the little mermaid. She could not believe that the prince was standing before her. She reached out to touch him, and he took her hand and lightly kissed it. The little mermaid blushed. Soon she realized, however, that she was wearing only a few seashells and flowers. She shivered.

"Where did you come from?" the prince asked. "You must be cold." He took off his cloak and wrapped it around the little mermaid. She tried to tell him who she was, but she made no sound. The prince took her back to the castle.

The prince was enchanted by this lovely girl. He spent every moment with her. He took her horseback riding and hiking up into the mountains. The prince felt that he had met the little mermaid before. Then he realized that she reminded him of the young girl who had taken him to a nearby church and nursed him back to health after the shipwreck. Then, without a word, she had completely vanished.

One day, the prince and the little mermaid went for an afternoon walk through the gardens. When they arrived back at the castle, the king and queen were waiting to talk to the prince. The prince was told that he had to meet a princess in the neighboring kingdom. The king and queen believed this princess would be the one he should marry.The prince insisted the ­little mermaid come with him for companionship. The little ­mermaid was happy to be with the prince, but she felt ­nervous that the prince would fall in love with the princess.

Soon they arrived at the neighboring kingdom. When the prince saw the princess, his mouth dropped open. The princess was the girl who had nursed him back to health! The prince and the princess immediately started talking. It was as if the little mermaid were no longer there. She walked off to sit and watch the water.Oh, what am I to do? the little mermaid thought. She cried into her hands as the waves crashed below her feet.

The next day, the castle was filled with activity. The two royal families were so sure that the prince and the princess were already in love that they had begun to plan the wedding.

When the prince awoke, he saw the little mermaid sitting alone. He sat down next to her and held her hand. When the little mermaid looked up at him, she expected to see pity in his eyes. But what she saw was a look she had been waiting to see. It was a look of pure love! The king and queen came into the room. They saw the prince and the little mermaid sitting together holding hands.

"Mother, Father, the princess and I will not be married," announced the prince. "This is my true love. I've known it for a long time but could not see it. I wanted too much to find the girl who took care of me after the shipwreck. Once I found her, I realized that my happiness was staring me in the face."The prince got down on one knee and proposed to the little mermaid. The little mermaid jumped up and kissed the prince's cheek.

The prince and the little mermaid were married that very day on the cliff overlooking the ocean. The little mermaid's family came to the surface to watch the happiest day of the little mermaid's life.''',

        '''My mom only had one eye. I hated her… she was such an embarrassment. My mom ran a small shop at a flea market. She collected little weeds and such to sell… anything for the money we needed she was such an embarrassment. There was this one day during elementary school.

I remember that it was field day, and my mom came. I was so embarrassed. How could she do this to me? I threw her a hateful look and ran out. The next day at school… "Your mom only has one eye?!" and they taunted me.

I wished that my mom would just disappear from this world so I said to my mom, "Mom, why don't you have the other eye?! You're only going to make me a laughingstock. Why don't you just die?" My mom did not respond. I guess I felt a little bad, but at the same time, it felt good to think that I had said what I'd wanted to say all this time. Maybe it was because my mom hadn't punished me, but I didn't think that I had hurt her feelings very badly.

That night… I woke up, and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. My mom was crying there, so quietly, as if she was afraid that she might wake me. I took a look at her, and then turned away. Because of the thing I had said to her earlier, there was something pinching at me in the corner of my heart. Even so, I hated my mother who was crying out of her one eye. So I told myself that I would grow up and become successful, because I hated my one-eyed mom and our desperate poverty.
Then I studied really hard. I left my mother and came to Seoul and studied, and got accepted in the Seoul University with all the confidence I had. Then, I got married. I bought a house of my own. Then I had kids, too. Now I'm living happily as a successful man. I like it here because it's a place that doesn't remind me of my mom.

This happiness was getting bigger and bigger, when someone unexpected came to see me "What?! Who's this?!" It was my mother… Still with her one eye. It felt as if the whole sky was falling apart on me. My little girl ran away, scared of my mom's eye. And I asked her, "Who are you? I don't know you!!" as if I tried to make that real. I screamed at her "How dare you come to my house and scare my daughter! Get out of here now!!" And to this, my mother quietly answered, "oh, I'm so sorry. I may have gotten the wrong address," and she disappeared. Thank goodness… she doesn't recognize me. I was quite relieved. I told myself that I wasn't going to care, or think about this for the rest of my life.

Then a wave of relief came upon me… one day, a letter regarding a school reunion came to my house. I lied to my wife saying that I was going on a business trip. After the reunion, I went down to the old shack, that I used to call a house…just out of curiosity there, I found my mother fallen on the cold ground. But I did not shed a single tear. She had a piece of paper in her hand…. it was a letter to me.
She wrote:

My son, I think my life has been long enough now. And… I won't visit Seoul anymore… but would it be too much to ask if I wanted you to come visit me once in a while? I miss you so much. And I was so glad when I heard you were coming for the reunion. But I decided not to go to the school…. For you… I'm sorry that I only have one eye, and I was an embarrassment for you. You see, when you were very little, you got into an accident, and lost your eye. As a mother, I couldn't stand watching you having to grow up with only one eye… so I gave you mine… I was so proud of my son that was seeing a whole new world for me, in my place, with that eye. I was never upset at you for anything you did. The couple times that you were angry with me. I thought to myself, 'it's because he loves me.' I miss the times when you were still young around me. I miss you so much. I love you. You mean the world to me.

My World Shattered. I hated the person who only lived for me . I cried for My Mother, I didn't know of any way that will make up for my worst deeds…
 
Moral: Never Ever hate anyone for their disabilities. Never disrespect your parents, don't ignore and under estimate their sacrifices. They give us life, they raise us better than they had been, they give and keep trying to give better than they ever had. They never wish unwell for their kids even in their wildest dreams. They always try showing right path and being motivator. Parents give up all for kids, forgive all mistakes made by kids. There is no way to repay what they done for kids, all we can do is try giving what they need and it is just time, love and respect. ''',

    content:'''Gramma Goodie visits her grandkids every Sunday afternoon. Every visit starts the same. First she rings the doorbell. Then Chris bounces down the stairs. Jamie runs to open the door. And every time, Gramma Goodie has gifts. But the kids never know what she'll bring.
Sometimes it's stuff you need, like socks or underwear.

Sometimes it's movie tickets or a giant teddy bear.It could be a kite or a stuffed baby kangaroo.

It could be a lollipop that turns your tongue bright blue.

Well, one Sunday, Gramma rang the doorbell. Chris hurried down the stairs. And Jamie threw open the door.

"Hello, my darlings," Gramma Goodie said with a smile. "Look what I have for you."

She pulled out a deck of cards, and they played "Go Fish" all afternoon. At the end of the day, Gramma gave everyone kisses. Then she said her good-byes.

As she drove away, Chris and Jamie heard their parents talking. They said that Gramma Goodie's birthday was next Sunday. They were going to plan a special dinner and bake a delicious cake for her birthday surprise.

"Gramma Goodie has a birthday?" they thought. Both were a little confused. Grown-ups have birthdays? Who in the world knew?

"Well, we have to get her a gift," Jamie decided.

"But what?" asked Chris. "Gramma Goodie has absolutely EVERYTHING!" Jamie thought about scarves, flowers, and perfume. But Gramma had plenty of scarves, a humongous rose garden, and bottles of French perfume. Chris thought about books and pillows, photo albums, and a flute.

A diary? She had one. An umbrella? She had that, too. A radio? There's one in her kitchen. Oh, what would Chris and Jamie do? They spent all week thinking. They thought in math class. They daydreamed during recess. They thought themselves to sleep! Nothing came to mind.

On Sunday, the doorbell rang. Chris didn't jump down the stairs. And Jamie didn't rush to the door.As always, Gramma Goodie had gifts. She gave Jamie some butterscotch and Chris some peppermint. They thanked her and left to think about Gramma's gift.

All through dinner, the kids were silent as mice.

"Now I can't have you upset on my birthday," said Gramma. "What's wrong with you two?"

"Gramma, we really wanted to give you something for your birthday," Jamie said.

"But nothing we thought of would do," added Chris.

Gramma Goodie smiled and scooped the kids up in her arms. Then she whispered in their ears. "Oh, kids, don't you know? You two are the best gifts I could ever ask for."

    content:'''The sky was still dark when Grandma woke up. It was Saturday, her favorite day of the week. Grandma went fishing every Saturday morning.
But today was special. Today Grandma was bringing some very special frogs with her on her Saturday fishing trip. "Wake up, my little ones," Grandma said. "It is time for us to catch some fish! It's going to be a great day."

Hoppy and Leapy sprung out of bed. They had never gone fishing with their grandma, and they were very excited. They threw off their frog pajamas and brushed their long tongues.

"Don't leave without us, Grandma!" they said.

"I would not dream of it," Grandma said.

Grandma helped the little frogs pack their fly and beetlebug jam sandwiches, they gathered their gear, and they were on their way. Leaping over each other's backs, they hopped down to the pond and onto Grandma's old rowboat.

"I have a feeling this is going to be a very good day," Grandma said.

Grandma, Hoppy, and Leapy paddled out into the middle of the pond. It truly was a beautiful day. The pond water was still, the sun was shining, and the sky was clear.

The three frogs pulled out their gear and cast their fishing line. They talked and talked and talked and fished all day long. When they were hungry, they ate their fly and beetlebug jam sandwiches.

Soon the sun began to set over the hills, and the sky turned a soft pink. Grandma drew in her fishing line and said it was time to go.

"Let's go tell Grandpa about my best fishing day ever!" she said, smiling proudly.

"But we didn't catch any fish!" croaked the kids. "How can it be your best day ever?"

Grandma laughed and let out a loud "Ribbit!" Pulling Hoppy and Leapy into her arms, she gave them a big hug.

"We didn't catch any fish, it's true," Grandma said. "But it was my favorite fishing day ever because I was able to spend it with you!"''',

    content:'''When baby Olivia cried, Daniel wanted to help. He was her big brother! But Mom and Dad would run to help her. They didn't even notice Daniel.
It was worse when she wasn't crying. If Olivia smiled or even burped, Mom and Dad would say, "Isn't she cute?" Daniel would think, "Hey, what about me?" Daniel had not expected it to be this way.

He thought they would play together. Daniel thought his Mom and Dad would be proud of him because he loved his baby sister. Instead, they forgot he was around!

Sometimes Daniel just sat and felt sad. Being a big brother was not fun at all. In fact, it was downright lonely.

That's what Daniel was thinking when the doorbell rang. At first he was excited because it was Grandma! Then he thought, "She's just coming to see Olivia. Great."

But Grandma surprised Daniel. She didn't go see Olivia. Instead she said, "Hi, Daniel! I've been looking forward to seeing you all day!"

"You have?" Daniel asked.

"I sure have," Grandma said with a smile. "Let's ride our bikes to the park."

At the park, Grandma and Daniel had bike races and played on the swings. They spent the next day building a fantastic castle at the beach.

"That little sister of yours is very lucky," Grandma said. "Someday, you'll show her how to do many fun things."

Daniel said, "I don't think so, Grandma."

"Sure you will!" said Grandma. "You'll teach her how to ride a bike, how to swing, and how to build a sandcastle that a princess would love!"

"Well, Olivia is a princess," said Daniel frowning. "At least Mom and Dad treat her like a princess."

"Oh, really," said Grandma. "And how do they treat Olivia's big brother?" "Like I'm not around," Daniel said with a sigh.

Grandma nodded. "I remember at this park last summer, I asked you to be careful on the swings. You said, ‘Grandma, please don't treat me like a baby.'"

Daniel remembered that, too.

"Mom and Dad treat Olivia in a special way," said Grandma. "They treat her like a baby. They treat you in a special way, too — like a big brother who doesn't need as much of their help now, and who will help take care of Olivia.

"Someday," Grandma continued, "Olivia will treat you in a special way, too — like her big brother. Her hero."

"She will?" asked Daniel.

Grandma nodded yes.

"Can we go home now?" Daniel asked. "I have to tell Olivia about the things I'll teach her."And that's exactly what Daniel — a proud big brother — did!''',

    content:'''This is one of the better animal stories for kids. Two crows lived near a woodland a long, long time ago. One of them was simple, while the other was cunning. The crafty crow has a habit of tricking the trusting crow. The honest crow, on the other hand, was always willing to assist the cunning crow.

One day, the honest crow was very hungry and was roaming in search of food. On the shore, the bird discovered an oyster. In order to eat the tasty meat inside, he needed to break open the item. He tried over and over, but the oyster refused to open.He then tried to extract the flesh with his large beak, but he was unable to open the shell. He then slammed a stone against the oyster, but it stayed completely shut. The oyster refused to open no matter how hard he tried.

"My dear friend, the oyster will not open the manner you are trying," another smart crow said as he flew by. I suggest that you soar high into the air with the oyster in your beak and then drop it on the rocks below. Only then will it crack open."

The hungry crow was impressed by the concept and decided to follow the advice. The oyster broke open as soon as the crow dropped it from above, as the bird flew up with it. The other smart crow, on the other hand, lifted it up and ate the meat within.

By the time the first crow arrived, all he could see were broken shell pieces. It was the only option available to him.

When the baby camel couldn't take it any longer, she inquired, "Why do camels have humps?" the next day. "Well, because we are desert animals, the humps let us store water for several days, so we can survive without water," the mother explained with a smile."Why do camels have long legs and rounder feet?" the newborn camel inquired. "These are made for walking in the hot desert," the mother responded. The camels' long legs and rounded feet make it easier for them to walk in the desert than anyone else!" "Mother, why do we have long eyelashes?" the inquisitive baby camel asked once more. It hurts my vision at times." "My dear kid, these long, thick eyelashes are your protective shield," Mother camel said proudly. They assist us in protecting our eyes from the sand and wind of the desert."

"Oh, I see," Baby Camel remarked after some thought. What in God's name are we doing here in the Zoo if the hump helps us store water while we're in the desert, the legs are for going through the desert, and these eyelashes protect our eyes from the desert?" Mother camel was speechless this time.

    content:'''This is one of the best children's jungle animal stories. Once upon a time, the jungle was home to a large, ferocious lion. He bullied every other animal because he was strong. Because of the lion, the animals could no longer dwell in harmony. As a result, they convened a conference to discuss how to stop the lion from disturbing them.

"We have to get rid of this lion!" exclaimed a hare. "I believe we need to select a champion among us to go teach him a lesson," says the group. The animals shouted and cheered, but the tiger refused entry, the elephant whistled, and the rhino read his book. No animal would voluntarily attack a lion.

Until an owl appeared and said, "Do not be afraid, my friends!" "I'll take on the lion!" Some of the animals were pleased. Some people felt the owl was crazy. They accepted because no one else offered. The word got around that the owl would confront the lion at his den the next morning. When the lion learned of the news, he burst out laughing. As a result, the lion was fully awake at sunrise the next day, waiting for the owl. All of the other animals were present, but the owl was not. The minutes, the hours, and the days passed with no trace of the owl! When the sun began to set and all of the animals began to return home, the owl finally appeared.

The lion shouted, "Why are you so late?" "I'm sorry, Mr. Lion!" said the owl. "However, on my way there, I came across a massive lion and was scared of him." I had to wait till he was asleep before I could come here! Oh, I'm pleased I'm fighting you instead of him!" The lion was stunned by what he was hearing. He wondered aloud, "Is there a lion stronger than me?" He demanded, "Take me to that lion right now."

As a result, the owl led him to a deep well nearby. "He went inside the last time I saw him!" said the owl. Inside the well, the lion crept in and roared as loudly as he could. Naturally, his own reflection shouted back, magnified by the echo. The roar was five times louder this time!

The stupid lion was so terrified that he ran as quickly as he could, never to be seen again. "BEING SMART IS WHAT MAKES US STRONGER!" the owl proved once more.

    content:'''As summer draws to an end, Mother Bear roams through the mountain forest, gathering and eating enormous amounts of berries and fruit. Mother Bear is putting on fat so she can sleep in her den the entire winter. The layer of fat will keep her warm and help her provide rich milk for the baby bear that will be born.

The air is turning cold. Mother Bear must hurry. She still has a lot of work to do. She must find a home for herself and her baby.

Mother Bear chooses a rocky cave to be her den during the winter. Inside the den, she and her baby will be protected from the cold wind and blowing snow. She pads it with moss, leaves, and grass to make it warm and soft for herself and the new baby.

As the first flakes of winter snow begin to fall, Mother Bear settles down and drifts off to sleep. Soon the falling snow will build up outside and close off the den, keeping Mother Bear and her baby safe from harm.

In the middle of winter, when the snow drifts are deep outside the den, Mother Bear's tiny cub is born. With closed eyes and hardly any fur, the cub will grow quickly, nourished by Mother Bear's rich milk.Baby Bear and Mother Bear sleep on, but Mother Bear will wake up and protect him if the winter home is disturbed. Mother Bear sits or lies on her side in her den and keeps her cub warm by cuddling him close to her warm body.

In a few weeks, Baby Bear's eyes open. He is now covered in thick, soft fur. Mother Bear and Baby Bear stay in their snug den another month.

Bear cubs will stay in the den for three months before they venture outside. During these three months, they spend most of their time sleeping. They wake only to drink their mother's milk.

In the spring, Baby Bear and his mother emerge from the den. Mother Bear shows Baby Bear how to look through the forest for tender shoots that will make a good meal.

Mother Bear makes her way with Baby Bear down the grassy slope to the elks' winter range. She lifts up her head and sniffs the breeze. Baby Bear moves his raised head back and forth so hard that he falls right over.

Bears have such small eyes that people often assume they also have poor eyesight, but bears probably see as well as most humans. Mother Bear finds an elk that died in the winter when the snows were deep and not enough food could be found. Mother Bear eats as much as she can of the nourishing elk meat. Then she carefully buries it in a shallow hole and covers it with leaves, twigs, and dirt. She will return to it later.

Baby Bear learns by watching what his mother does. The most important rules for Baby Bear to learn are to follow mother, obey mother, and have fun.Bear cubs stay with their mother about two years. During this time, they learn many survival tips, such as what to eat and how to escape danger, before they venture out on their own.Mother Bear teaches her baby cub to turn over fallen branches and look for grubs to eat. With their long, sharp claws, Baby Bear and Mother Bear dig up bulbs, roots, and snails.

Bears will eat almost anything they can get their paws on, including grasses, berries, tree bark, plants, insects, some small mammals, and, of course, sweet honey!

When his mother stops to rest, Baby Bear likes to play. He climbs all over her. He somersaults into her lap and nibbles her ears, then runs off to chase a tiny field mouse.

When Mother Bear looks up from playing with her cub, she sees that a lean wolf is watching her and Baby Bear. Quickly she chases the cub into a hollow tree stump. Then she turns to face the wolf.Mother Bear stands up on her hind legs, swings her front paws, and roars a loud growl. The wolf runs away.

Bears have five claws on each foot. They use their front paws for catching and holding prey, digging for insects and roots, and climbing trees.

Mother Bear calls to her cub, but he doesn't come out of the hollow stump. Mother Bear goes to find out why. Baby Bear has found a treat. It is a honeycomb with honey from last summer still inside. Baby Bear sticks his little paw in the honeycomb and then licks it. He tastes the wildflowers of summer in the sweet honey.As Baby Bear's first summer draws to an end, he is able to find his own food, although he might drink milk from Mother Bear occasionally. Now he must eat as much food as he can to prepare for his winter sleep. When Baby Bear backs out of the hollow log, he brings some tasty honeycomb for his mother. She happily eats the honey, and then she and her cub give each other a true bear hug.''',

    content: '''Today is a special day! In a warm, quiet corner of the barn Mama Cat nestles in the hay and gives birth to five kittens. Mama Cat dries Farm Kitten and his sisters' wet fur with her tongue.

Even though their eyes aren't open, the kittens use their sense of smell to find their favorite spot to nurse each time they eat. Nursing is important since Mama Cat's milk keeps the kittens from getting sick.

As the kittens get older, Mama Cat will teach them how to become mousers and help the farmer. Mousers catch mice and rats that eat the farmer's corn and grains.

Farm Kitten is two weeks old now. His eyes are open and he can hear. But Farm Kitten still stays close to Mama Cat. He mews to his sisters, and they sleep together in a pile of warmth and comfort when their mother is out hunting for food.

Mama Cat leaves her kittens safe in the barn when she goes out to catch a mouse or a rat.

Mama Cat has caught a rat today. Back at the barn, she shows her kittens how she caught it. All of the kittens will need to hunt for themselves someday. Farm Kitten watches his mother very carefully.

Farm Kitten is four weeks old and ready to explore. He steps out from his soft bed of hay. There are so many new sounds and sights and smells!

Farm Kitten hears a noise in one of the stalls. He jumps up on the stall divider and swings his tail sideways to keep his balance. In the stall, he sees a huge brown cow! What a big animal! He fluffs up the hair on his back and tail, and hisses as loud as he can. The big cow just keeps chewing her hay. She is not scared of Farm Kitten.Farm Kitten looks down from his high place. He stretches as far as he can toward the ground, then slides the rest of the way down the stall.

Out in the barnyard, Farm Kitten smells the muddy wallow that the pigs are enjoying. As Farm Kitten tries to get a closer look, one of the pigs trots by him. Splish! Splat! Farm Kitten is all muddy!

Farm Kitten finds a quiet spot to wash himself. He wants to remove the mud and the scent of the pigs from his fur. Smells are very important to cats, and Farm Kitten doesn't want to be mistaken for a pig! Plus, washing helps to calm Farm Kitten.He licks his paw and then wipes his face with it. Farm Kitten tugs at the fur between the pads of his feet to get all of the mud out. A clean, fluffy coat will keep Farm Kitten warm and dry.When Farm Kitten is finished grooming, he sees his mother down by the pond with the rest of the kittens. At last, Farm Kitten can watch her hunt. But this is a different kind of hunting. Farm Kitten pricks up his ears and watches his mother closely.

His mother looks down in the water for a long time. Suddenly, she darts her paw under the water and throws a flipping, flopping fish up on the grass!

Farm Kitten has never seen a fish before. It splashes him when it moves. Farm Kitten doesn't like getting wet any more than he likes getting muddy. But he tries to hunt, anyway. He dips his paw in the water, scaring all of the fish away.

Mama Cat doesn't want Farm Kitten to be so close to the water. She picks him up by the scruff of his neck and carries him away from the pond. Kittens have loose skin around their necks so Mama Cat can carry them without hurting them.

Farm Kitten's sisters rush over to him once their mother sets him down. It's playtime! Farm Kitten finds a dragonfly. The other kittens wrestle with one another, trying to hold on with their front paws while they kick with their back paws.

Kicking with their back paws protects their soft stomachs. Their mother has taught them this from the time they were very young.

Stalking in the grass, they practice creeping up on one another. They crouch down low and wait for just the right moment to pounce. Farm Kitten pounces again and again. Sometimes he catches his sister. But sometimes he misses!

Suddenly, Farm Kitten spots a crow pecking in the grass. Farm Kitten stays low in the grass. He waves his tail in the air. Farm Kitten's swishing tail gives him away. The crow's sharp eyes see the tail as a warning, and the bird flies away. Farm Kitten tries to pounce, but all he catches is a pawful of air.Maybe next time, Farm Kitten! Farm Kitten's wagging tail has attracted one of the farm puppies. Even though Farm Kitten and the puppy are both baby animals, they have different body signals.

The puppy doesn't know that Farm Kitten wags his tail when he is angry. Puppies wag their tails when they are happy.

When Farm Kitten raises his paw to swat the puppy away, the puppy wants to play. The puppy barks, wanting to join in a game. Farm Kitten climbs up a tree to get away from the puppy. There, he waits for the puppy to go away.

It has been a busy day, and Farm Kitten is ready for a nap. His senses of sight and smell work together to help him find his way back to the barn.

Suddenly, Farm Kitten hears a high-pitched squeak. He pricks up his ears and walks slowly into the barn. It is dark inside, but Farm Kitten can see just fine. Cats have special eyes that help them see in dim light.Just then, Farm Kitten spots a rat at the end of the barn! He creeps closer, using his whiskers to tell him when he is getting too close to objects in the barn. Farm Kitten doesn't want to bump into things and scare away the rat before he can pounce.

Farm Kitten leaps at the rat — but misses! It runs off into the hay. Maybe Farm Kitten will catch a rat tomorrow. Now he is sleepy. Farm Kitten crawls back to his soft bed and gently falls to sleep. He dreams of becoming a true mouser one day.''',

He builds up speed until he can leap out of the water and land on the ice. Then he shakes the water off his feathers. It is now Father Penguin's turn to stay close to the nest so Mother Penguin can go fishing.
Mother Penguin climbs from the nest. Her movements wake her baby. Baby Penguin blinks her bright black eyes.

Baby Penguin is a slowpoke. When she was born, she took half a day to break out of her shell. It takes a long time for her to eat, too. And even though she is three weeks old, she has never left her nest.

Baby Penguin looks around. Penguins are everywhere, and they are all squawking loudly! They sure are noisy.

Penguins are birds, but they cannot fly. Baby Penguin's wings are really more like flippers. Although she'll never fly in the sky like other birds, Baby Penguin will be able to fly through the water with her special wings.

Each family of penguins guards its nest. If a stranger gets too close, Father Penguin stretches his neck. His neck feathers fluff out. He points his head up to the sky and grunts. Baby Penguin stretches her neck and grunts, too.Father Penguin and his baby tell the stranger to keep away from their home.Father Penguin protected Baby Penguin when she was just an egg, too. He held the egg on top of his feet so it wouldn't touch the ice for almost two months. A flap of warm belly skin covered the egg and kept it warm. Baby Penguin is lucky to have Father Penguin!

Mother and Father Penguin must go fishing often to catch enough food for their tiny baby. They will have to leave her for a while. Baby Penguin's mother and father bring her to a group of young penguins. She slowly waddles after them.

Baby Penguin will be safe in this group. The older penguins will watch for danger. They circle around the babies and shelter them from cold winds. If an enemy approaches the babies, the adult penguins will beat their wings and screech, scaring the enemy away.

Baby Penguin snuggles with the others. She falls asleep. Baby Penguin does not notice the group moving away from her. She wakes up and sees a bird diving at her! Luckily, an older penguin is nearby. The big penguin runs toward Baby Penguin, waving his flippers and barking loudly. He scares the bird, and it flies away! Baby Penguin hasn't learned how to escape danger yet. Soon Mother and Father Penguin will teach her how to swim really fast through the water and away from danger.Baby Penguin goes back to the other penguins. She is frightened and very hungry. Suddenly she hears her father calling to her! Will he find her? Baby Penguin is lost in a crowd of fuzzy little black penguins that look just like her.

Baby Penguin lifts her head and barks as loudly as she can. Her parents hear her over all the other noise. They find her!

Baby Penguin is happy to return to the nest with Mother and Father Penguin. She knows it is time for them to feed her the fish that they have caught in the sea. Penguins get all of their food from the ocean. They eat fish, crab, and squid. They also eat small sea creatures called plankton. Penguins have spiky tongues that help them grip the slippery fish in their beaks.

When penguins get thirsty, they can eat snow to quench their thirst. And they can drink salty ocean water without getting sick.

After Baby Penguin eats her meal, Mother and Father Penguin "clean house." They replace the rocks that have tumbled off their nest pile.

A snowstorm has blown in from the ocean. Large, white flakes are falling everywhere. Baby Penguin is lucky to have her parents to shelter her from the cold winds and keep her warm.Penguins have bodies that are built for the coldest weather on earth. Their bodies are covered with three layers of tiny, waterproof feathers, which keep out the cold wind and keep in their body heat. They also have a thick layer of fat all over their bodies to keep them warm.The penguin family huddles together. When the sky clears, the snow will melt. It will be fishing time again! A few weeks have passed. Baby Penguin has new feathers. Now she looks like a grown-up. Baby Penguin flaps her flippers. Now she is ready to go somewhere. So are the other penguins. They form a big group near the water.

Baby Penguin follows them. She uses her flippers to slide across the cold ice on her belly. Baby Penguin quickly discovers that sliding is the best way to get around on the cold snow and ice. Penguins do this by using their fat bellies as toboggans. It is now time for the young penguins' first swim in the sea. Baby Penguin is one of the last little penguins to dive in. She's really swimming fast! Baby Penguin is no longer such a slowpoke!''',

Bangalore. She was a lively child who loved playing, studying,
writing short stories, dancing, and singing. She was a bright student of
the Indian International School.
One day her father got some work in their native village; Rima was
pleased to hear the news. She convinced her father to accompany him on
the trip. It was a matter of two days, so her father agreed. She packed
her luggage and was very excited to visit their village.
When she reached there, she saw the kaccha houses / temporary
houses made of mud or clay. She felt the quietness of village life. There
were areas full of greenery where one could breathe fresh air. Cattle were
moving around, and farmers were working in the field. Children were
playing and enjoying themselves. Then she saw some boys going to a
village school and girls going to farms with sharp knives. It was weird to
her. She thought, "Why are girls not going to school?"
She followed one girl named Bindra to the farm. Rima asked her,
"Hi, why are you not going to school?"
Bindra said, " I never went to school. My brother goes to school,
and I help my parents on the farm." Her answer shocked Rima.
Then she told Bindra that according to the Constitution of India,
"free and compulsory education for the age group of six to fourteen years
is the Fundamental Right of all children."
Ahe continued, "So it would help if you went to school, and
afterwards you can help your parents. And every citizen of India is treated
as equal, and there is no difference between boys and girls. Governments
have created equal opportunities for everyone. So, we should follow it."
These words touched Bindra because she also wanted to study like
her brother. So she promised that henceforth she would also go to school
to fulfil her dreams and be a strength for her parents.
The moral of the story is that education gives us identity and helps
us make the right decisions.

    content:'''The story starts in Corinth. At the time of this story, Corinth was ruled by a man called Periander who lived about 600 years before the birth of Christ.
We will hear more about Periander, and Corinth another time, but for now, I'll explain that he loved the arts, including wonderful columned buildings, paintings on pottery, and music. In his time, the most famous musician in Greece was a man called Arion, who was born on the Greek island of Lesbos, near Turkey. Periander invited Arion to come and stay with him in Corinth and to play his music at the court.

So what was Arion's music like? I'm not going to try and give you a rendition, but I can say he sang and played the lyre which is a stringed instrument. As he was born near Asia, I think his music would have sounded slightly Eastern. He was particularly famous for inventing a kind of song and dance dedicated to Dionysus the Greek god of wine. Well the followers of Dionysus were known for being pretty wild, and it seems likely that the music of Arion would have been a bit out there, and had a good stomping beat to it. As he was so famous, we might think of him as a sort ancient rock star.

Herodotus tells us that he made his base at Periander's court in Corinth, but he also liked to go on tour from time to time. He was invited to go and play his music at a festival in Sicily, situated in the toe of Italy. There was a Greek settlement there. Arion travelled to Sicily, performed to great acclaim, and was paid a good sum of gold for his appearances. Like I said, he was something of a rock star of his times, and he was both mega famous AND rich.

After his tour of Sicily, he took a boat back to Corinth. The crew of this boat understood that they had a VIP passenger, and that he had plenty of money with him, and as they were a rough sort, they decided to rob him. So when they were out at sea, the ship's captain gave Arion a choice - he could commit suicide, and they would give him a proper burial on land, or he could jump overboard. It wasn't much of a choice, but Arion remained composed. He chose to jump into the sea, but before doing so, he made a last request. Could he sing and play his lyre one more time? He promised that when he had finished singing, he would jump over the side of the ship into the waves.

Herodotus tells us that the sailors were delighted to have a private performance from the world's most famous singer, and they readily agreed. Arion changed into the special robes that he wore for his performances, and he sung his heart out.

Now Herodotus does not actually say this, but I would like to add a detail. Perhaps the sailors were not his only audience. It might be that some keen eared dolphins heard him and gathered round the ship to listen to his music. At any rate, what happened next suggests that might be the case.

Arion, as he had promised, jumped into the sea, and the crew sailed away with his gold, having greatly enjoyed his last ever performance.

But Arion did not drown as they had expected, because he was saved by a dolphin. The dolphin picked him up on his back, and swam until he was near enough to dry land for his human passenger to scramble ashore, at Cape Taenarum, on the bottom of the Peloponnese, where there was a temple to the sea god, Poseidon, and also the Cave of Hades, which the Greeks believed was the entrance to the underworld of the dead.

From there, a wet but very much alive Arion made his way across the Peloponnese back to Corinth where he told Periander the story of the robbery and his incredible rescue by the Dolphin.

Now Periander thought the story was so amazing that he was really not sure whether or not to believe it, and he put Arion under arrest. When the boat that had carried Arion arrived at Corinth, he summoned the crew to his palace.

"What news do you have of our famous singer, Arion?" he asked.

The crew replied that he was still in Sicily and doing well.

At that moment, Arion, who had been listening to all this from behind a curtain, stepped out into full view, still wearing his performing costume, just as the sailors had seen him last before he made his leap from the ship. They were so struck with amazement, that they weren't able to deny their dastardly plot.

And Herodotus tells us that he has heard this story from both the Corinthians, and the people of Lesbos, and that he has seen a bronze statue of a Arion riding the dolphin in the temple at Cape Taenarum where he came ashore.

So Herodotus clearly believed the story of Arion and the Dolphin. Many people, however seem to think that this is a myth - meaning that it's probably not true.

In fact, the famous English historian, Edward Gibbon, called the story of Arion, "A most unphilosophical fable since it supposes the friendship of a man and a seafish."

Elsewhere he remarked that Herodotus, "Sometimes writes for children, and sometimes writes for philosophers." I think he's using the word philosophers in the meaning of those who love wisdom and truth.

But is the story so unlikely? The sea of course is mainly full of fish, but dolphins live there too, and they are unusual because, like us, they are mammals. Mammals are animals that feed their offspring on breast milk. Dolphins form close families, protect one another, even give each other gifts, speak to each other with sounds, and generally act in ways that are not entirely different from us humans. So Gibbon, writing in the 18th Century, was wrong to call them seafish.

In fact, we have modern stories of people making friends with dolphins. In the year 2004, the British long-distance swimmer, Adam Walker was swimming across New Zealand's Cook Strait when he noticed a great white shark beneath him. To his great relief, a pod of about 10 dolphins kept him safe until the shark swam off, about an hour later.

In the same year, also in New Zealand, a lifeguard called Rob Howes, reported that dolphins protected him and his two daughters from sharks. And there are many other such stories.

When I was growing up, my favourite part of a family trip to the Safari park was to see the dolphin show. The trainers could command the dolphins to perform tricks like jumping through hoops. And sometimes a trainer swimming in the pool, would hold onto a dolphin's fin, and the dolphin would pull him or her through the water.

So while I think it's not possible that Arion actually rode on the back of a dolphin, because he would have slipped off, it's not so completely impossible that dolphins helped him, and maybe he held onto one of them.

However, I have to say that perhaps I am letting my feelings affect my judgement. If you've ever listened to Storynory, you probably know that I have a soft spot for stories about animals who are friends to humans. Perhaps I'm inclined to believe the dolphin story because I want to believe it.

We will never know the truth about Arion and the Dolphin for sure, but we do know that Periander, tyrant of Corinth, did exist, and that there were Greek settlements in Sicily in the West, and that Greeks lived on the eastern side of the Mediterranean sea on islands near Turkey. These widely spread Greeks had different rulers, but they shared a language, religion, and culture, and they were connected by sea trade. It's perfectly possible that Periander invited a popular singer called Arion from Lesbos to come and stay with him in Corinth, and that Arion travelled to Sicily, and that he was robbed at sea.

Anyway, kids, as always, you are the jury. It's up to you to listen to the story, perhaps do your own research, weigh the evidence, and decide which parts you believe to be true, and which parts you think might be myth. Use your own judgment and use it wisely.

And I am delighted to dedicate this story to Alex, aged 4 and Emily, Aged 6 in California. Their family has become our latest supporter on Patreon, and their dad Joe writes:

"We love Storynory and listen every Saturday morning at Breakfast. Hope our contribution helps pay for coffee and more stories! We love the new Herodotus and especially the Birdy series! Thank you for entertaining our mornings and expanding our imaginations."

And thank you Joe, Alex and Emily for supporting us, because it really means the world to us when our listeners give us a little help.

Next time, I'll be telling you about an extremely wealthy leader called Croesus, king of Lydia, in Asia, who considered himself to be the luckiest man alive - a claim which the Greeks thought was presumptuous. '''

    images: ["assets/images/category/motivational.jpg","assets/images/motivational/story_1.jpg"],
    content:'''"The Butterfly" is a motivational short story about the process of transformation and growth.  Sometimes this story is referred to as "You are Made to Fly."

In the story, a man finds a cocoon with a small opening and notices a butterfly struggling to emerge.

The man decides to help the butterfly by widening the opening, but the butterfly continues to struggle and cannot fly properly.

The man soon realizes that the struggle to emerge from the cocoon is an important part of the butterfly's development.

The effort and resistance of the struggle are necessary for the butterfly's wings to become strong and for it to develop the ability to fly.

The story is often used as a metaphor for personal growth and the importance of facing challenges and struggles in order to achieve our full potential.

Just like the butterfly, we may encounter obstacles and difficulties in our lives, but these challenges can help us become stronger and more resilient.

If we avoid or eliminate all struggles, we may miss out on the growth and development that comes from overcoming them.

The lesson of the butterfly story is to embrace the struggles and challenges in our lives, as they are often necessary for our growth and development.

We should trust the process of transformation, even when it is difficult or uncomfortable, as it can lead to beautiful and meaningful outcomes. ''',

    content:'''The story of "The Fisherman" is a metaphorical tale about the pursuit of happiness and the importance of living a simple, fulfilling life.

In the story, a successful businessman visits a small fishing village and meets a fisherman who is returning from a day of fishing.

The businessman asks the fisherman why he doesn't fish for longer each day and use the extra time to grow his business.

The fisherman responds that he is content with his simple life, and that he fishes only enough to provide for his family and to spend time with them.

The businessman is confused by the fisherman's contentment and explains that if he worked harder and saved more money, he could eventually retire and spend his days relaxing on a beach just like the fisherman.

The fisherman responds by asking why he would need to work so hard and wait so long to enjoy the simple pleasures of life when he can already do so now.

The story is often used as a metaphor for the pursuit of happiness and the importance of living a simple, fulfilling life.

It suggests that we often become so focused on achieving success and accumulating wealth that we forget the simple pleasures and joys of life that can be found in spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, and enjoying the present moment.

The lesson of the fisherman story is to prioritize the things that truly bring us happiness and fulfillment in life, rather than pursuing a never-ending quest for more money, possessions, or success.

It reminds us to appreciate the simple pleasures of life and to focus on the things that matter most to us. '''

"The finest in the whole country," said the crafty Fox, "jump in and try it. There is more than enough for both of us."

    images: ["assets/images/category/adventure.jpg","assets/images/adventure/story_1.png"],
    content:
       ''' "Once upon a time, in a cozy little village nestled beside a wide, sparkling ocean, there lived a young inventor named Finn. Finn had a heart full of dreams and a head full of brilliant ideas. His workshop was a wondrous place, cluttered with bits and bobs, gears and gadgets, all waiting to be turned into his next amazing creation. But Finn's most exciting invention of all was a tiny, shiny submarine, just big enough for one brave adventurer.

The submarine was a marvelous contraption, painted a bright yellow, with a little propeller on the back and a glass dome on top that let Finn see the ocean all around him. He had built it himself, piece by piece, with the help of his trusty toolbox and the guidance of his imagination. But this was no ordinary submarine. It was made for a special journey, one that Finn had been dreaming of for a long time.

Beneath the waves, hidden from the world above, lay the fabled underwater kingdom of Luminaqua, a magical realm where glowing jellyfish danced like tiny lanterns and friendly sea dragons glided gracefully through coral palaces. Finn had heard stories of this enchanting place from his grandfather, who used to tell tales of its beauty and wonder. And now, with his submarine ready, Finn was determined to find Luminaqua for himself.

One sunny morning, with the ocean sparkling under the golden rays of the sun, Finn gently pushed his submarine into the water. He waved goodbye to the village folk who had gathered to watch him embark on his adventure. With a deep breath and a flutter of excitement, Finn climbed inside, closed the hatch with a satisfying click, and turned on the engine. With a whirr and a whoosh, the submarine began to sink beneath the surface, and the adventure began.

As the submarine descended, Finn peered through the glass dome, marveling at the vibrant colors of the sea. Schools of fish darted past, shimmering like rainbows. Sea turtles paddled lazily, and seaweed swayed gently in the current. The deeper Finn went, the darker the water became, until all around him was a deep, mysterious blue.

Just as Finn began to wonder if he would ever find Luminaqua, a soft glow appeared in the distance. It shimmered and danced, like moonlight on water. Finn steered the submarine toward the glow, his heart beating with anticipation. As he drew closer, he could see that the light came from countless jellyfish, each one glowing like a tiny lantern in the deep sea.

Finn's eyes widened in wonder as the submarine glided into the kingdom of Luminaqua. The jellyfish surrounded him, their tentacles trailing like ribbons as they twirled and danced. Finn felt like he was inside a living, breathing work of art, with colors and lights all around him. But there was more to see, and Finn was eager to explore.

As he ventured further, Finn caught sight of a grand coral castle rising from the ocean floor. It was built from towering coral spires, each one encrusted with sparkling seashells and pearls. And in front of the castle swam a group of sea dragons, their scales glimmering like jewels. They were magnificent creatures, with long, sinuous bodies and gentle faces. One of them, the largest of the group, noticed Finn and swam closer, her eyes twinkling with curiosity.

"Hello there, little inventor," said the sea dragon in a voice as soft as the ocean breeze. "I am Seraphina, the guardian of Luminaqua. We've heard tales of your clever inventions, and we welcome you to our kingdom."

Finn grinned from ear to ear. "Thank you, Seraphina! It's an honor to be here. I've dreamed of this moment for so long."

Seraphina smiled warmly. "Come, let me show you the wonders of our world."

With Seraphina leading the way, Finn explored the kingdom of Luminaqua. They swam through gardens of coral, where seahorses played hide-and-seek among the anemones. They visited the grand hall of the coral castle, where the walls glowed with the light of thousands of tiny sea stars. Everywhere Finn looked, there was something new and magical to discover.

Finn was amazed by the harmony of this underwater world. The creatures of Luminaqua lived in peace and joy, and Finn felt a deep sense of belonging. He shared stories of his village and his inventions, and the sea creatures listened with fascination.

As the sun began to set above the waves, painting the ocean in shades of pink and gold, Finn knew it was time to return home. He thanked Seraphina and all the creatures of Luminaqua for their kindness and hospitality.

"You are always welcome here, Finn," said Seraphina, her voice filled with warmth. "Remember, the magic of Luminaqua is in your heart, and it will guide you wherever you go."

With a final wave, Finn climbed back into his submarine and began the journey home. As he rose through the water, he watched Luminaqua slowly fade into the blue, its glow a gentle reminder of the adventure he would always cherish.

When Finn emerged from the sea, the stars were twinkling in the night sky, and the village lights welcomed him back. He was greeted with cheers and hugs from his friends and family, eager to hear about his incredible journey.

That night, as Finn lay in bed, he thought about the adventure he had just experienced. He knew that the beauty and magic of Luminaqua would stay with him forever, a shining memory he would carry in his heart.

And from that day forward, Finn continued to invent and create, inspired by the wonders of the underwater kingdom. He shared his stories and inventions with the world, spreading the joy and magic of Luminaqua to all who would listen.

And so, the tale of Finn, the brave inventor, and his tiny submarine became a bedtime story told by many, reminding everyone that dreams can come true and that adventure awaits those with the courage to seek it.

The End."'''

    images: ["assets/images/category/adventure.jpg","assets/images/adventure/story_2.jpg"],
    content: '''Once upon a time, in the heart of a sprawling kingdom nestled between misty mountains and lush green forests, there lived a curious young princess named Nova. She had luscious golden curls and eyes that sparkled like the morning dew on a field of wildflowers. Nova was not like any ordinary princess; she was driven by an insatiable curiosity that often led her on exciting adventures within the castle's towering walls and beyond.

One breezy morning, as the sun painted the sky with strokes of pink and orange, Nova sat by her bedroom window, gazing at the endless stretch of the royal gardens. She felt the crisp air tickle her cheeks and whispered quietly to herself, "What wonders lie beyond the garden fence?" Her heart fluttered with anticipation, like the gentle wings of a butterfly.

Nova decided that today would be the day she'd find out. Carefully, she tiptoed past her slumbering nursemaid and snuck out of the castle, her little feet barely making a sound on the stone floors. She wore a simple dress, perfect for exploring, and a small satchel slung across her shoulder. Inside, she had packed some essential items: a tiny notebook, a pencil, and a little magnifying glass—a gift from her wise old grandfather.

As she approached the garden, the gate creaked open with a soft sigh, as if inviting her in. Nova stepped into the world of vibrant flowers and towering trees, her heart beating with excitement. She meandered through the familiar paths, until she reached the tall, ivy-covered stone wall that marked the edge of the known garden.

Nova's eyes caught a glimpse of something unusual—a small, hidden door nestled among the vines. It was old and wooden, with intricate carvings of mystical creatures. A keyhole gleamed in the sunlight, and as if by magic, a small, silver key appeared on the ground before her feet.

With a flutter of her heart, Nova picked up the key and gently turned it in the lock. The door swung open, revealing a hidden path that glowed with an ethereal light. Nova hesitated for a moment, but her curiosity won over her caution. She stepped through the doorway, feeling a tingle of magic in the air.

The secret garden spread out before her, a paradise of wonder and enchantment. The colors were more vivid than anything she had ever seen; the flowers sang softly with the breeze, and the trees whispered tales of old in languages long forgotten. Nova's eyes widened with delight as she took in the magical scenery.

As she wandered deeper into the garden, she heard a gentle rustling. From behind a large, shimmering bush, a tiny creature emerged. It was a woodland sprite, no taller than Nova's hand, with wings that glistened like the morning dew. "Welcome, Princess Nova," the sprite chimed, its voice as soft as a lullaby.

Nova blinked in surprise. "You know my name?" she asked, her voice filled with awe.

The sprite nodded, its eyes twinkling like stars. "Indeed, we all know you. This is the secret garden, where magical creatures dwell. We have awaited your arrival."

Just then, a chorus of chattering filled the air, and Nova saw more creatures appear—a family of tiny, giggling fairies, a wise old owl perched on a branch, and even a mischievous fox with a bushy tail and a playful grin.

The fox trotted up to Nova, bowing with a flourish. "Princess Nova, I am Felix. Would you care to explore this garden of wonders with us?"

Nova nodded eagerly, her cheeks flushed with excitement. "I'd love to, Felix!" she exclaimed, clapping her hands.

The creatures led Nova through the garden, where every corner revealed a new marvel. They stopped by a pond, its water shimmering like a mirror, where colorful fish leapt joyously. The fairies dipped their toes into the water, creating ripples that danced in patterns of light.

"These fish," explained the wise old owl, "are the guardians of the pond. They teach us the value of harmony and balance. Watch how they swim together, never straying far from one another."

Nova watched in fascination, understanding that even the smallest creatures played an important role in the world. She noted it down in her little notebook, her heart swelling with appreciation for the lesson she had learned.

Moving along, the group came upon a field of daisies, where a family of rabbits nibbled on the sweet grass. The eldest rabbit, with fur as soft as a cloud, hopped over to Nova. "In our community," she said, "we care for each other, sharing the joys and burdens of life."

Nova smiled, learning from the rabbits' gentle wisdom. She realized how important it was to be part of a community, where love and kindness flourished like the daisies around them.

Soon, they reached a grove where the trees stretched high into the sky, their branches dancing in the wind. A family of squirrels darted through the leaves, gathering acorns for the coming winter. Nova marveled at their industriousness and teamwork.

Felix the fox explained, "The squirrels remind us of the value of hard work and preparation. They work together so they may all thrive through the cold months."

Nova nodded, understanding the importance of working together towards a common goal. She scribbled this down as well, her heart brimming with newfound wisdom.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the garden, Nova felt a sense of peace and fulfillment. She realized that the secret garden wasn't just a place of magic and wonder, but a place where she had learned invaluable lessons about life.

The creatures gathered around her, their eyes warm and welcoming. "Now you know the secrets of our garden, dear Nova," said the sprite, fluttering before her. "It's a place where magic and wisdom are woven into the very fabric of nature."

Nova smiled, her heart full of gratitude. "Thank you, all of you, for showing me the wonders of your world. I promise to cherish these lessons and share them with others."

With a final wave, Nova bid farewell to her new friends and retraced her steps to the garden's hidden door. She stepped back through, closing the door behind her, knowing that she could return whenever she needed to.

As she made her way back to the castle, Nova felt a renewed sense of wonder for the world around her. She knew that the magic of the secret garden would always live within her, guiding her on new adventures and reminding her of the value of curiosity and wonder.

That night, as she snuggled into her bed, the moonlight spilling in through her window like silver threads, Nova fell asleep with a smile on her face. Her dreams were filled with the laughter of fairies, the wisdom of owls, and the gentle rustling of leaves in a garden that was forever a part of her heart.

And so, the curious princess learned that the world was full of magic, waiting to be discovered by those who dared to seek it, with open hearts and minds ready to embrace the beauty of every moment. And from that day forward, Nova's adventures continued, each one more wondrous than the last, as she shared the magic of the secret garden with those she loved, spreading the seeds of wonder far and wide.

    content:
        '''Once upon a time, in a land filled with the magic of laughter, there lay a quaint village known as Giggleglen. Now, Giggleglen was no ordinary village. It was a place where the trees swayed to the sound of chuckles, and the wind carried whispers of giggles through the air. Laughter wasn't just an expression of joy here; it was a powerful spell that could heal wounds, lift spirits, and bring happiness to all who lived within its bounds.

In the heart of Giggleglen stood a grand and ancient tree known as the Chucklewood Oak. It was said that this magnificent tree, with its gnarled roots and sprawling branches, was the source of the village's laughter. Its leaves would shimmer with mirth, and with every breeze, a chorus of joyful laughter would echo throughout the village, casting the spell of happiness upon the residents.

The people of Giggleglen, from the tiniest of tots to the eldest of elders, knew the importance of laughter. They would gather around the Chucklewood Oak every evening to share jokes, tell funny stories, and simply laugh together. This ritual ensured that the laughter spell remained strong, and that joy was an ever-present force in the village.

Now, in this village lived a little girl named Elina. Elina had a laugh so pure and delightful that it could make even the grumpiest of grumps crack a smile. Her laughter, like twinkling stars, had the power to light up the darkest of nights. Elina loved to laugh, and she loved to make others laugh even more. The villagers often said that her giggles carried the truest essence of Giggleglen's magic.

One day, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink, a peculiar thing happened. A silence, as thick and heavy as a woolen blanket, fell over Giggleglen. The birds stopped chirping, the leaves on the trees ceased their rustling, and even the Chucklewood Oak stood still, its laughter spell seemingly frozen in time.

The villagers gathered under the once-joyous tree, their faces etched with concern. Without the laughter spell, their homes felt cold, their meals tasted bland, and their hearts grew heavy. They turned to one another, searching for an answer, but no laughter came.

It was Elina who, despite the silence, kept a spark of hope alive in her heart. She believed that if she could just make one person laugh, the spell would be awakened and the laughter would return to Giggleglen. So, with a determined heart, Elina set out on a quest to reignite the magic of laughter.

Her first stop was at the house of Old Man Whiskers, the oldest and seemingly grumpiest person in the village. Elina knocked gently on his door and waited. The door creaked open, and there stood Old Man Whiskers, his face as long as the evening shadows.

"Good evening, Mr. Whiskers," Elina greeted him with a smile. "I've come to share something special with you."

"And what might that be?" grumbled Old Man Whiskers.

"A joke!" Elina proclaimed. "Why don't scientists trust atoms?"

Old Man Whiskers raised an eyebrow, curiosity getting the better of him. "I haven't the faintest idea," he replied.

"Because they make up everything!" Elina exclaimed, unable to contain her own giggle.

A moment passed, and then another. And then, like the first drop of rain after a drought, a small chuckle escaped Old Man Whiskers' lips. It was a rusty, creaky sound, but it was a chuckle nonetheless. The spell of laughter had found a tiny crack to seep through.

Elina, feeling encouraged, continued her quest. She visited house after house, telling jokes, making funny faces, and performing silly dances. With every stop, a few more chuckles joined the chorus, each one weaving its magic through the village air, pulling at the threads of the silent spell.

As the night grew darker, Elina's journey led her to the town's grumpy baker, Mrs. Dough, who hadn't let out so much as a snicker in years. Elina told her the silliest story she knew, about a pie that wanted to fly and see the world. To Elina's delight, Mrs. Dough's stern face cracked, and a booming laughter erupted, filling her bakery with warmth.

With each laugh, the Chucklewood Oak seemed to stir, its leaves shivering with excitement. The magic was returning, and so was the village's joy.

Finally, Elina made her way to the center of Giggleglen, where the villagers had gathered once more, this time with smiles beginning to bloom on their faces. Elina climbed onto the stage that had been set up by the Chucklewood Oak and cleared her throat, her heart pounding with anticipation.

"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls," Elina began. "I have traveled through our beloved village tonight, spreading the joy of laughter. But now, it's time for all of us to come together and laugh as one!"

She took a deep breath and told the funniest story she knew, filled with ridiculous characters and absurd twists. The villagers listened, and as Elina reached the punchline, an explosion of laughter erupted from the crowd. The laughter was so loud, so heartfelt, that it shook the leaves of the Chucklewood Oak, and the spell came bursting back to life.

The tree glowed with a brilliant light, and the magic of laughter weaved through every home, every heart, and every soul in Giggleglen. The village was once again filled with the sound of pure joy, and the Chucklewood Oak stood tall and proud, its laughter spell stronger than ever.

From that night on, the villagers of Giggleglen never forgot the power of laughter and the little girl who had reminded them of it. They promised to cherish every chuckle, every giggle, every guffaw, for they knew that laughter was not just a sound, but a spell that bound them together in happiness.

And so, the village of Giggleglen lived on, forever enveloped in the magic of laughter, a place where joy was never too far away, and where a child's laugh could indeed be the most powerful spell of all. As the stars twinkled above and the Chucklewood Oak whispered its laughter through the night, the children of Giggleglen drifted off to sleep, knowing that in their dreams, they too could spread the joyous spell of laughter.

The end. ''',

    content:'''Once upon a time, in the mystical land of Whimsyshire, there was a sea captain known far and wide for his booming laugh. This wasn't just any ordinary laugh; it was the kind of laugh that made the sun shine a little brighter and the flowers bloom a little faster. His name was Captain Chuckleton, and he was as famous for his laughter as he was for his seafaring adventures.

However, one gloomy day, something peculiar happened. Captain Chuckleton woke up, and just like that, his famous laugh was gone! He opened his mouth to let out his usual hearty "Ha-ha-harrr," but all that came out was a quiet wheeze. The captain was bewildered and knew he had to find his lost laugh or Whimsyshire would be a much duller place without it.

So, he decided to embark on a ludicrous journey across the land of Whimsyshire, searching high and low for his missing laughter. With a determined heart and a hopeful spirit, Captain Chuckleton set sail on his beloved ship, The Giggling Gull, waving goodbye to the townsfolk who wished him luck on his quest.

The first place Captain Chuckleton visited was the Valley of Giggling Grass. It was said that the grass here laughed when tickled by the wind. He wandered through the valley, trying to catch the contagious giggles of the grass, but alas, his own chuckle remained elusive.

Next, the captain ventured into the Forest of Funny Foliage. Here, the trees told the silliest of jokes, and the bushes chuckled along with every breeze. Captain Chuckleton listened intently to the joking oaks and the snickering pines, but his laugh was nowhere to be found.

Feeling a bit down but not defeated, Captain Chuckleton set his course for the Mountains of Mirth. It was rumored that the mountaintops tickled the clouds until they laughed raindrops. As he climbed the amusing altitudes, Captain Chuckleton couldn't help but smile at the thought of giggling clouds. Still, his own laugh remained silent.

Determined to continue, Captain Chuckleton visited the Desert of Delight. In this vast expanse of sand, there lived a tribe of chuckling cacti. They loved to share puns and play pranks on each other, causing waves of laughter to ripple through the desert air. Captain Chuckleton chuckled softly at their antics, but his trademark laugh was still missing.

On he journeyed to the Silly Sea, where the dolphins performed hilarious flips and the clams clapped in applause. The sea itself seemed to be in stitches as the waves rolled with merriment. Captain Chuckleton sailed through, chuckling here and there, yet his laugh was not fully restored.

Feeling slightly weary, he directed The Giggling Gull toward the Isle of Jest, an island where everything was upside down and inside out. The trees grew roots up and leaves down, and the rabbits wore hats on their feet. Captain Chuckleton found the sight amusing, but his booming laugh was still absent.

Just when Captain Chuckleton was about to lose hope, he spotted an island on the horizon that was not marked on any map. This was the Island of Whispers, and it was said to be a mystical place where the most unexpected magic could happen.

Upon setting foot on the island, Captain Chuckleton felt a strange tickling sensation in his belly. He followed the feeling and came upon a clearing where the air itself seemed to shimmer and laugh quietly. In the middle of the clearing stood a grand tree, with leaves that whispered secrets of joy.

Captain Chuckleton approached the tree and listened. As he did, the whispers grew louder, and the tickling sensation intensified. Suddenly, the captain burst into laughter, a laugh so loud and joyful that it echoed across the island and out to sea.

But just as suddenly as it came, the laughter stopped. Confused and a little worried, Captain Chuckleton asked the tree, "Why did my laughter stop?"

The tree whispered in reply, "True laughter comes from within, from moments of happiness shared with friends and loved ones. Your laugh will return to you when you open your heart to the joy that surrounds you every day."

Understanding dawned on Captain Chuckleton. He realized that his quest had taken him to many wonderful places, but he had been so focused on finding his laugh that he hadn't fully appreciated the moments of joy he had encountered along the way.

With newfound wisdom, Captain Chuckleton decided it was time to return home to Whimsyshire. He thanked the whispering tree and set sail once more on The Giggling Gull, his heart lighter than it had been in weeks.

As he sailed back, he thought of all the laughter and smiles he had seen on his journey. He remembered the playful dolphins, the joking trees, the upside-down rabbits, and all the delightful sights that had brought him so much joy.

When Captain Chuckleton finally arrived in Whimsyshire, he was greeted with a grand celebration. The townsfolk had missed their beloved captain and his infectious laughter. They welcomed him with open arms, sharing stories and jokes, and filling the air with happiness.

And then, in the midst of the celebration, it happened. Captain Chuckleton threw back his head and let out a laugh so hearty and so full of joy that it seemed to shake the very foundation of Whimsyshire. It was his laugh—the one that had been missing for so long.

The townsfolk cheered, and soon everyone was laughing along with Captain Chuckleton. The flowers bloomed faster, the sun shone brighter, and Whimsyshire was once again filled with the magical sound of laughter.

From that day forward, Captain Chuckleton never lost his laugh again. He had learned that laughter wasn't something to be found on a quest but rather something to be nurtured and cherished in the company of friends and the simple joys of everyday life.

And as the children of Whimsyshire drifted off to sleep each night, they could hear the distant sound of Captain Chuckleton's laughter on the breeze, a gentle reminder that joy is never far away if you just open your heart to it.

So now, dear child, as you close your eyes and dream of adventures in the land of Whimsyshire, remember the tale of Captain Chuckleton and his quest for laughter. May your dreams be filled with joy, and may you wake to a world as full of laughter as the captain's beloved Whimsyshire. Goodnight, sweet dreams, and may your every chuckle be as bright as the stars above. '''

    content:'''A poor boy named Aladdin used to live with his mother. One fine day, a rich stranger came to their house looking for the boy.

"I am a merchant," he said to Aladdin's mother, "I have come from Arabia to take your son with me for a little work. I will pay your boy so much that you will not be poor anymore."

Aladdin's mother agreed because they really needed the money to survive. However, the man who said he was a merchant was actually a magician.

The following day, Aladdin packed his belongings and left with the merchant. They travelled for many hours before the merchant stopped. Aladdin was taken by surprise, as it was a lonely spot, and there was no one around.The merchant took out some coloured powder from his pocket and threw it at the ground. The next moment there was a lot of smoke all around. As the smoke cleared, Aladdin saw a big cave-like opening in the ground. The merchant said to Aladdin,

"Go inside. You will find a lot of gold inside the cave, more than you will ever see in your entire life. Take as much gold as you want." "There is an old lamp inside the cave; just get that lamp out for me," said the merchant.

Aladdin became suspicious and entered the cave. Inside, he saw that the cave was filled with gold. He filled all his pockets with gold, as much as he could, and started looking for the lamp and found it. The lamp was old and dirty. Aladdin took the lamp and called out to the merchant to help him come out of the cave."Hand me over the lamp first," the merchant said.

Aladdin was afraid that if he first gave the lamp, the merchant would leave him inside the cave. So, he requested him to pull him out first. The merchant got angry hearing this, took out some more powder from his pocket and threw it at the cave. The opening of cave closed with a huge rock. Aladdin was very scared and started shouting, hoping that someone would come and help him out. Many hours passed by, but no one came to help him.

As Aladdin was sitting alone inside the cave, he started cleaning the lamp. Suddenly, a strange fog filled up the cave, and a voice appeared,

"My master, I am the genie of this lamp. How can I help you? Tell me your wish."

It was a huge man who looked quite strange.

"Take me to my home," Aladdin said to him.

The next instant, Aladdin was at home with his mother. Aladdin told her all about his adventure with the merchant. Aladdin rubbed the lamp and called the genie again. He asked him for a palace, and soon Aladdin and his mother were living inside a beautiful palace.

Aladdin became famous and was married to the princess, the daughter of the Sultan, they were very happy. The magician who came disguised as a merchant, heard all about Aladdin. He came to the palace disguised as an old man who exchanged old lamps and gave new ones. Aladdin had not told the princess about his magic lamp. She gave it to the magician. As soon as he saw the lamp, he recognised it and ran away, grabbing it.

The magician summoned the genie, and he was now the new master.

"Shift Aladdin's palace far away from here to the desert," he said to the genie.

When Aladdin returned to the place of his palace, he could not find it or his princess and mother. He was very worried but then realised that it must be that evil magician who wanted to take revenge on him. Aladdin thought hard and remembered the magician gave him a ring that could help him. Aladdin rubbed the ring, and another genie appeared.

"Take me to wherever my princess and palace are," Aladdin instructed the genie.

The very next moment, Aladdin found himself in the desert near his palace and his princess. The magician was also there, and the lamp was placed on a table next to him. Aladdin quickly jumped and grabbed the lamp before the magician could realise what was going on. He quickly rubbed the lamp, and the genie appeared.

"My master, how can I serve you again?" the genie asked

"Send this evil magician to an unknown place, from where he can never return or harm anyone," Aladdin said.

"Whatever you want, my master," said the genie, and the magician disappeared, never to return again.

The genie transports Aladdin back to where his palace was earlier. Aladdin lived happily with his wife and mother. '''

    content:'''The story takes place in Baghdad during the Abbasid era. Ali Baba and his elder brother Cassim are the sons of Ali Baba and forty thievesa merchant. After the death of their father, the greedy Cassim marries a wealthy woman and becomes well-to-do, building on their father's business - but Ali Baba marries a poor woman and settles into the trade of a woodcutter.

One day Ali Baba is at work collecting and cutting firewood in the forest, and he happens to overhear a group of forty thieves visiting their treasure store. The treasure is in a cave, the mouth of which is sealed by magic. It opens on the words "Open, Simsim", and seals itself on the words "Close, Simsim". When the thieves are gone, Ali Baba enters the cave himself, and takes some of the treasure home.

Ali Baba borrows his sister-in-law's scales to weigh this new wealth of gold coins. Unbeknownst to Ali, she puts a blob of wax in the scales to find out what Ali is using them for, as she is curious to know what kind of grain her impoverished brother-in-law needs to measure. To her shock, she finds a gold coin sticking to the scales and tells her husband, Ali Baba's rich and greedy brother, Cassim. Under pressure from his brother, Ali Baba is forced to reveal the secret of the cave. Cassim goes to the cave and enters with the magic words, but in his greed and excitement over the treasures forgets the magic words to get back out again. The thieves find him there, and kill him. When his brother does not come back, Ali Baba goes to the cave to look for him, and finds the body, quartered and with each piece displayed just inside the entrance of the cave to discourage any similar attempts in the future.

Ali Baba brings the body home, where he entrusts Morgiana, a clever slave-girl in Cassim's household, with the task of making others believe that Cassim has died a natural death. First, Morgiana purchases medicines from an apothecary, telling him that Cassim is gravely ill. Then, she finds an old tailor known as Baba Mustafa whom she pays, blindfolds, and leads to Cassim's house. There, overnight, the tailor stitches the pieces of Cassims' body back together, so that no one will be suspicious. Ali and his family are able to give Cassim a proper burial without anyone asking awkward questions.

The thieves, finding the body gone, realize that yet another person must know their secret, and set out to track him down. One of the thieves goes down to the town and comes across Baba Mustafa, who mentions that he has just sewn a dead man's body back together. Realizing that the dead man must have been the thieves' victim, the thief asks Baba Mustafa to lead the way to the house where the deed was performed. The tailor is blindfolded again, and in this state he is able to retrace his steps and find the house. The thief marksforty thieves the door with a symbol. The plan is for the other thieves to come back that night and kill everyone in the house. However, the thief has been seen by Morgiana and she, loyal to her master, foils his plan by marking all the houses in the neighborhood with a similar marking. When the 40 thieves return that night, they cannot identify the correct house and the head thief kills the lesser thief. The next day, another thief revisits Baba Mustafa and tries again, only this time, a chunk is chipped out of the stone step at Ali Baba's front door. Again Morgiana foils the plan by making similar chips in all the other doorsteps. The second thief is killed for his stupidity as well. At last, the head thief goes and looks for himself. This time, he memorizes every detail he can of the exterior of Ali Baba's house.The chief of the thieves pretends to be an oil merchant in need of Ali Baba's hospitality, bringing with him Forty thieves hiding in oil jarsmules loaded with thirty-eight oil jars, one filled with oil, the other thirty-seven hiding the other remaining thieves. Once Ali Baba is asleep, the thieves plan to kill him. Again, Morgiana discovers and foils the plan, killing the thirty-seven thieves in their oil jars by pouring boiling oil on them. When their leader comes to rouse his men, he discovers that they are dead, and escapes.

To exact revenge, after some time the thief establishes himself as a merchant, befriends Ali Baba's son (who is now in charge of the late Cassim's business), and is invited to dinner at Ali Baba's house. The thief is recognized by Morgiana, who performs a dance with a dagger for the diners and plunges it into the heart of the thief when he is off his guard. Ali Baba is at first angry with Morgiana, but when he finds out the thief tried to kill him, he gives Morgiana her freedom and marries her to his son. Ali Baba is then left as the only one knowing the secret of the treasure in the cave and how to access it. Thus, the story ends happily for everyone except the forty thieves and Cassim. '''
